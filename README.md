NextBus-JSON-API
================

The nextbus api but as JSON instead of XML

This is (or will be) a Django app that can serve as a JSON alternative for the nextbus XML API. The Python code that parses the XML into JSON should be pretty easy to extract from the app if you just want that. As I get further into the project I'll provide instructions for using that without the whole Django part.
